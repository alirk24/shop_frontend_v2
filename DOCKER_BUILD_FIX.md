# 🐳 Docker Build Fix Summary

## 🐛 Issues Found in Server Build:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**: API base URLs not available during Docker build
2. **Invalid URL Error**: Components making API calls during static generation with undefined base URLs
3. **Build Failures**: API calls failing during build time causing the entire build to fail

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Added Environment Variables to Dockerfile**
```dockerfile
# In builder stage
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://api.ark-24.ir
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BLOG_BASE_URL=https://api.ark-24.ir
```

### 2. **Fixed API Error Handling**
- **about-us component**: Added try-catch with fallback to empty array
- **home component**: Changed from throwing errors to gracefully handling failed API calls with empty arrays

### 3. **Created Environment Files**
- Added `.env` file for Docker builds
- Maintained `.env.local` for local development

### 4. **Updated Next.js Configuration**
- Added experimental options to improve build stability
- Reduced worker threads to prevent memory issues

### 5. **Updated Docker Ignore**
- Excluded example components and test files from Docker builds
- Reduced build context size

## 🚀 **How to Build Now:**

```bash
# Build with Ubuntu Dockerfile (recommended)
docker build -f Dockerfile.ubuntu -t petshop_bi_lan .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 petshop_bi_lan
```

## 🔧 **Key Changes Made:**

### **Before (Problematic):**
```tsx
// Would throw error and break build
if (rejectedIndex !== -1) {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
}
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```tsx
// Gracefully handles failures with empty arrays
const processedResults = results.map((result, index) => {
  if (result.status === 'rejected') {
    console.warn(`Failed to fetch data for request ${index}:`, result.reason);
    return []; // Return empty array for failed requests
  }
  return result.value;
});
```

## 📊 **Expected Build Results:**

✅ **Build should now complete successfully**
✅ **API failures during build won't break the process**  
✅ **Application will show empty states when API is unavailable**
✅ **All language filtering functionality preserved**

## 🐛 **If Build Still Fails:**

1. **Check environment variables are set**
2. **Verify API endpoints are accessible**
3. **Use `docker build --no-cache` for clean build**
4. **Check Docker logs for specific errors**

The application will now build successfully even when the API server is unavailable during build time!
